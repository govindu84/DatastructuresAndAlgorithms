What is DataStructre?
It is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively. 

Why Datastructures?
They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerfull algorithms.
They help to manage and organize data

Abstract Data type
An Abstract data type(ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structre must adhre to.
The interface doe not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what progamming language.

Complexity analysis
Time complexity: How much time does this algorthim takes to finsih.
Space complexity: How much space does this algorthim need for its computation.

Big Oh Notation, Ο
It is the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It measures the worst case time complexity or the longest amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.
Algorithm Complexity can be constant, logarithmic, linear, n*log(n), quadratic, cubic, exponential, etc.
***n-is the size of input 
Constant Time: O(1)
Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
Linear Time: O(n)
Linearimithic Time: O(nlong(n))
Quadric Time:O(n2)    ** n power of 2
Cubic Time: O(n3)     ** n power of 3
Exponential Time: O(2n) ** 2 power of n
Factorial Time :O(n!)
